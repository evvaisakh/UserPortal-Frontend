        Concepts
    ----------------

    1. Modules : organize the application parts into cohesive blocks of functionality. Each block focuses on providing a specific functionality or a feature.
    2. Component : contains the data and user interaction logic that define how the View looks and behaves
    3. Style components : provide style globally and locally
    4. Decorators : to provide meta data
    5. Selectors : used to display component in a template
    6. Data Binding : shairing data within a component
        - One way Binding : data shairing only in one direction
            - ts (compoenet) to html (view)
                - String Interpolation : use {{compoenet property}} in template
                - Property Binding : binding class property with tag attribute, 
                    [tag-attribute]="property"
            - html (view) to ts (compoenet)
                - event binding : (event)="function-call"
                - event binding with event as '$event', (event)="function-call($event)"
                - event binding Using template reference variable, use #templateReferenceVariable, (event) = "function-call(templateReferenceVariable)"
        - Two way binding : data shairing  in both direction at the same time
            - TemplateDriven Forms : first form tag in html part
                - 'ngModel' Directive : used to sahre data in two way
                - Import 'FormsModule' in module file
                - [(ngModel)]="compoent-property"
                - Applying validation
                    - 
            - ModelDriven Forms : first create model in ts file and linked with html later
    7. Setup Path for component
        - use app-routing.module.ts file to define path for compoenet
        - setup path as 'object' in 'Routes' array of app-routing.module.ts file
        - { path:'' , component:component-name }
        - use 'router-outlet' directive in app.component.html file to render component according the url
        - 'routerLink' attribute of a tag is used to redirect from one page to another in angular without refreshing
    8. Angular Directives : Class used to provide special behavior to angular elements
        - Component : used to display a compoenet in browser, ex: selector of a compoenet
        - Attribute : used to give style to angular elements
            - ngClass : used to provide class of style to angular elements
        - Structural : used to change structure of angular elements by adding or removing elements, use * symbol to indicate its structural directive
            - *ngIf : used to add/remove elements based on condition
            - *ngFor : used to display array in angular
                - *ngFor="let variable-name of array-name"
        - ngModel : used to manage user input data from its view and helps to perform 2 way binding
        - ngForm : used to manage form 
    9. Dependency Injection : used to communicate a class with another predefined class in angular
        - it should in the argument of constructor 
        - access-specifier variable-name:dependent-class-name
        - also use inject method to depedency injection
    10. Angular Services : To share common logic between components
        - To create service : ng g s service-folder/service-name
    11. Asynchronous function handling in Angular
        - RXJS (Reactive Extension for JS)
            - use 'Observable' to resolve asynchronus function
                - subscribe(observer object / callback function) : used to resolve resolved state,
                    observer object  : 'next' key which hold only server success response, 'error' key which hold only server/client error response
                - catch() : used to resolve reject state
            - API call based on observable
                - Import 'HttpClientModule'
                - 'httpClient' class
                    - consist of all http method
    12. 'AcivatedRoute' Class : Provides access to information about a route associated with a component 
    13. Pipes : used to transform user inputs to another format
        - Inbuilt pipes : 
        - Userdefined pipes
        - syntax: userData | pipe-name [:option]
    14. Parent child communication
        - parent to child : parent can share its 'property' to child, child must have Input decorator to accept parent data
        - child to parent : child can share only 'event' to parent, child must have Output decorator to pass data in any event to its parent 
        - 'EventEmitter' class : to generate user defined event, to execute userdefined event we have use emit method 
    15. Angular Guards : To Guard / protect the routes from unauthorized access 
        - CanActivate: Controls if a route can be activated.
        - CanActivateChild: Controls if children of a route can be activated.
        - CanLoad: Controls if a route can even be loaded. This becomes useful for feature modules that are lazy-loaded. They won’t even load if the guard returns false.
        - CanDeactivate: Controls if the user can leave a route. Note that this guard doesn’t prevent the user from closing the browser tab or navigating to a different address. It only prevents actions from within the application itself.
